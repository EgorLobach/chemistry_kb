<h3>Physical properties and structure of metals</h3>
<br>The melting points of pure metals lie in the range from -39 ° C (mercury) to 3410 ° C (tungsten). The melting point of most metals (except for alkaline metals) is high, but some "normal" metals, for example, tin and lead, can be melted on a conventional electric or gas stove.
<br>Depending on the density, metals are divided into light (density 0.53 ÷ 5 g / cm³) and heavy (5 ÷ 22.5 g / cm³). The lightest metal is lithium (density 0.53 g / cm³). The heaviest metal is currently impossible to name, since the densities of osmium and iridium - the two heaviest metals - are almost equal (about 22.6 g / cm³ - exactly twice the density of lead), and calculate their exact density is extremely difficult: this requires completely clean metals, because any impurities reduce their density.
<br>Most metals are plastic, that is, the metal wire can be bent and it will not break. This is due to the displacement of the layers of metal atoms without breaking the bond between them. The most plastic are gold, silver and copper. Of gold, you can make a foil thickness of 0.003 mm, which is used for gilding products. However, not all metals are plastic. Wire from zinc or tin crunches when bent; manganese and bismuth under deformation in general almost do not bend, but immediately break down. Plasticity depends on the purity of the metal; So, very pure chrome is very plastic, but, contaminated even with minor impurities, it becomes brittle and harder. Some metals, such as gold, silver, lead, aluminum, osmium, can coalesce with each other, but this can take decades.
<br>All metals conduct electricity well; this is due to the presence in their crystal lattices of mobile electrons moving under the action of the electric field. Silver, copper and aluminum have the greatest electrical conductivity; for this reason the last two metals are most often used as a material for wires. Very high electrical conductivity has also sodium, attempts have been made in the experimental apparatus to use sodium conductors in the form of thin-walled stainless steel tubes filled with sodium. Due to the low specific gravity of sodium, with equal resistance, sodium "wires" are much lighter than copper wires and even slightly lighter than aluminum ones.
<br>The high thermal conductivity of metals also depends on the mobility of free electrons. Therefore, a number of thermal conductivities are similar to a series of electrical conductivities, and silver is the best conductor of heat, as well as electricity. Sodium also finds use as a good conductor of heat; It is widely known, for example, the use of sodium in valves of automobile engines to improve their cooling.



<h3>Chemical properties</h3>
At the external electronic level, most metals have a small number of electrons (1-3), so in most reactions they act as restorers (that is, "give up" their electrons)

Reactions with simple substances
<ul>
	<li>All metals except oxygen and platinum metals react with oxygen. The reaction with silver occurs at high temperatures, but silver (II) oxide is practically not formed, since it is thermally unstable. Depending on the metal, oxides, peroxides, and perperoxides may appear at the outlet:
	<br>4Li+O<sub>2</sub> → 2Li<sub>2</sub>O - sodium oxide
	<br>2Na+O<sub>2</sub> → Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> - sodium peroxide
	</li>
	<li>
Only the most active metals react with nitrogen, only lithium reacts at room temperature, forming nitrides:
		<br>6Li+N<sub>2</sub> → 2Li<sub>3</sub>N
	</li>
		<li>
		With sulfur react all metals except gold and platinum:
		<br>Fe+S → FeS
	</li>
		<li>
Only the most active metals react with carbon. In this case, acetylenides or methanides are formed. Acetylenides in the interaction with water give acetylene, methanides - methane.
		<br>2Na+2C → Na<sub>s</sub>C<sub>2</sub>
	</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Being in nature</h3>
Most of the metals are present in nature in the form of ores and compounds. They form oxides, sulphides, carbonates and other chemical compounds. For the production of pure metals and their further application, it is necessary to separate them from ores and carry out purification. If necessary, doping and other processing of metals. The study of this is the science of metallurgy. Metallurgy distinguishes ores of ferrous metals (based on iron) and non-ferrous (iron does not include them, only about 70 elements). Gold, silver and platinum also belong to precious (noble) metals. In addition, in small quantities, they are present in sea water and in living organisms (playing an important role in this).
It is known that the human body is 3% composed of metals. Most of all in the body of calcium (in bones) and sodium, acting as an electrolyte in the intercellular fluid and the cytoplasm. Magnesium accumulates in the muscles and nervous system, copper in the liver, iron in the blood.

<h3>Application of metals</h3>
Since the properties of nonmetals are extremely diverse, these substances find wide application in various branches of the national economy.
<ul>
	<li>Construction materials:
Nonmetals such as sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorine are used as raw materials for the production of acids and other products.
	<br>Metals and their alloys are one of the main constructional materials of modern civilization. This is determined, above all, by their high strength, uniformity and impermeability for liquids and gases. In addition, changing the formulation of alloys, you can change their properties in a very wide range.</li>
	<li>Electrotechnical materials:
	Metals are used as good conductors of electricity (copper, aluminum), and as materials with increased resistance for resistors and electric heating elements (nichrome, etc.).</li>
	<li>Tool materials:
	Metals and their alloys are widely used for the manufacture of tools (their working part). Basically, these are tool steels and hard alloys. Diamond tools, boron nitride and ceramics are also used as instrumental materials.</li>
