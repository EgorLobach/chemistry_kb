Bismuth is of great importance for the production of so-called "automatic steels", especially stainless steels, and very much facilitates their machining by machine-tools (turning, milling, etc.) at a concentration of bismuth of only 0.003%, while not increasing the tendency to corrosion . Bismuth is used in aluminum-based alloys (about 0.01%), this additive improves the plastic properties of the metal, dramatically simplifying its processing.</p>
